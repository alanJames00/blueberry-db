# VelocityDB

**VelocityDB** is a light-weight Redis-compatible in-memory database built in Go. It provides basic key-value data storage and hashes with persistence via an Append-Only File (AOF) mechanism and is designed to be compatible with most Redis clients including, but also not limited to redis-cli and ioredis.
